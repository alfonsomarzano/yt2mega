## yt2mega

yt2mega is a free webtool that automatically downloads youtube videos, converts them into MP3s and uploads them to your personal MEGA.NZ account

File conversion happens on the server, but upload to MEGA servers happens on the client side, so your API Keys are never submitted to the server.

### Server
Powered by NGINX and PHP, uses youtube-dl to download video files, and ffmpeg for video-> mp3 conversion.
